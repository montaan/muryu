      <h3>Hello there!</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome, welcome! What you're looking at is a zoomable file manager.
        Think zoomable map, but replace cities with directories and buildings
        with files.
      </p>
      <h4>Navigation</h4>
      <p>
        Use the mouse wheel to zoom the camera towards and away from the pointer.
        You can also use the <b>t</b> and <b>g</b> keys to zoom.
        To pan the map, grab and drag the map with the pointer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right-click on things to show their context menus. Use the Ctrl-key to
        show the browser context menu.
      </p>
      <h4>Selecting</h4>
      <p>
        Select items by ctrl-clicking on them. Select a range from the last selected
        item by shift-clicking the end of the range. Ctrl-drag to lasso select.
      </p>
      <h4>Contacts</h4>
      <p>
        Add new contacts by clicking on the "Contacts"-button
        at the top of the screen. The contacts window also lets you create new groups,
        invite people to your groups and join public groups.

      <p>
        Upload files and archives from your computer by clicking the
        "Upload"-button at the top of the screen.
        When you discover something good on your browsing escapades,
        use the Muryu Firefox add-on to send it your map with a single click.
      </p>
      <h4>Sharing</h4>
      <p>
        To share your discoveries, select the things you wish to share and
        click on "Share with a group" or "Share with the world." If you're
        using the Muryu Firefox add-on, select "Share with a group" or "Share
        with the world" from the pop-up menu.
      </p>
