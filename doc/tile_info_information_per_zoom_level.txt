Tile info for different zoom levels
-----------------------------------

1280x1024 screen contains 42 tiles, including border cache.

Info per item assuming compression factor of 2.
Tile info per screen ~400kB, 200kB compressed.

Possible information division per zoom level:

0: 2.8M items, 1.2 bits per item
  server-side:
    - colors
    - high-level patterns a must
  client-side:
    - not doable to have per-item details
    - color fields drawable with canvas (may be hard to implement gradient mesh
      though?)
    - can draw borders around wanted areas and put a piece of text there
    - websom-style drawing should be doable

1: 688k items, 5 bits per item
  - ditto for above

2: 172k items, 2 bytes per item
  - tile-relative item coordinates for querying item data from tile_info

3: 43k items, 10 bytes per item, +8 bytes
  + rating, item type, set memberships?

4: 11k items, 40 bytes per item, +30 bytes
  + user, dimensions, ref

5: 2.7k items, 160 bytes per item, +120 bytes
  + related items, date, size

6: 672 items, 640 bytes per item, +480 bytes
  + src, tags, top comments

7: 168 items, 2.5kB per item, +1.9kB
  + all comments, all metadata, top related items data

8: 42 items, 10kB per item, +7.5kB
  + more related items data, editor data

9: 10 items, 40kB per item, +30kB
  + metadata revisions, all related items data

10: 8 items, 50kB per item, +10kB
  + related items top related items

information_utility = amount_of_information * quality_of_information

Information utility measures the capability of making an informed decision based
on the given information.


quality_of_information = q(presentation, (information & needed_information))

Quality of information is a function of how well the information is presented
and how the presented information matches the needed information.


presentation = presentation_quality * (presentation_style & viewer_capabilities)

How well information is presented depends on the quality of the presentation
(graphics used, text used, typography, etc.) and how well the presentation
matches the capabilities of the viewer (slideshow to a blind person vs.
pseudo-code to a programmer.)


Tile image size and screen size
-------------------------------

Tile image size 12kB would give 42*12kB = 504kB in images, for a total screen
size of 700kB.

With a 2Mbps internet connection, a screen would take 3.5 seconds to load,
with the first tile shown after ~50ms. On a mobile phone, the screen will be
a lot smaller, meaning around 12 tiles and 172kB per 240x320 screen. With a
384kbps 3G connection, loading the screen would take 3.6 seconds, with the
first tile shown after 0.3 seconds. With a 64kbps connection (~EDGE) loading
the screen would take 21.5 seconds, with the first tile loaded at 1.9 seconds
(+ 2 seconds of latency). With 32kBps GPRS, screen: 43s, first tile 3.8s.


Tile preloading strategy
------------------------

Assuming an usage pattern of quick zoom to medium & near overview, then
pan to seek out interesting things, zoom in to far detail for more browsing -
in essence panning as function of zoom, with more panning when zoomed near -
it'd make sense to do less pan preload when zoomed out and instead prioritize
preloading a couple zoom levels of tiles under the cursor. When zoomed in, the
preload would prioritize panning, with zoom level preload taking a lower
priority.
