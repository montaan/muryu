 Goal/Technological product under development
 
  What are we building in this project, what is the final result?
   The Google Map of file managers - a zoomable file manager that can show millions of 
   files at a glance. (The new technology.)
   And around it, a social bookmarking site focusing on large collections of related 
   items and discussion around them. (The application.)
   And a recommendation system that matches ads to the items. (The business model.)

 The technology being developed / Core of the project
 
  What is the technological core of the project, phases in implementation / tasks and 
  possible milestone results. What new value does the developed technology bring to the 
  company or the field?
   The technological core of the project is doing realtime database queries with result 
   set sizes in the millions and visualizing the whole result set.
   Milestone results are having a site handling tens of thousands of items with hundreds
   of users running on a single computer, then scaling the capability to million items
   on a single computer and parallelizing that to hundreds of millions of items on 
   hundreds of computers.
   New value is in doing this for the web, and doing it in a responsive and scalable
   fashion.
