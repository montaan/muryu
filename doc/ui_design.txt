Utility
-------

- Claus and Pjotr have listings of their model train cars on future. Both have
  several copies of some cars and a list of wanted cars. Find possible trades.
  - claus.wanted & pjotr.dupes, pjotr.wanted & claus.dupes

- Laura wants to find the best photograph from a series to send it to the art
  director for the new Fiat ad
  - first pick the good ones, then do side-by-side comparisons to drop the
    not-best ones, then do side-by-side comparisons between the best to find
    the very best one
  - what might be a good way:
    1. zoom to the wanted series in the series list
    2. zoom in to view the photos in medium detail
    3. click on good ones to add them to the selection
    4. make selection area fill the screen
    5. add two slideshows over the selection area
    6. remove the not-best ones from the selection by looking at the selection
       view and comparing photos using the slideshows
    7. find the very best one by comparing photos using the slideshow
    8. email the best photo to the AD by dragging it to the email app
       or select the AD's email addy from the contact list and send it that way
       or select the AD's future account from the contact list and send it there
    9. move on to the next task

- Reading schedule
  - organize reading into what is planned to read, what is currently reading
    what has already read, what didn't bother to read
  - move things to the to-read list by clicking the read emblem on them
    - to-read list calculates the total time it takes to read through all and
      shows it to you
    - "read" is a bit of a misnomer, since the to-read list can contain any sort
      of items
    - to-read list can split itself into n-hour chunks to schedule your reading
      across several days
  - when you start reading a document, it is moved to "currently reading"
  - when you finish reading, you tick the "completed" or "skipped" -box to move
    it to one of those sets


Fun
---

- Jaded from the cute fade animations and shaking 24pt font-size login forms of
  Web 2.0, Hezekiel seeks solace from the bosom of future.
  A very feast for the senses! The mix of materials and texture, artful
  design with its detail gradients, animations and fireworks of success renew
  Hezekiel's faith in humanity.

- Beatrice is bored and depressed from the continuous rain.
  The dark grey design doesn't help. Ah, to see the hills of Provence~

- Thomas is testing deleting stuff. The Delete-character with her emergency
  hammer is amusing! Delete more, Thomas, delete more!


Everyday errors
---------------

- Thomas accidentally deleted his collection of kitten pictures and now wants
  it back.


Relaxation
----------

- Beatrice plays Massive Attack and views a slideshow of Provence landscape
  photos while sipping tea.


Profit
