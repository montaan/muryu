UI design, or what does future let you to do better than you could before
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

See and act on a large collection of files and their relations.

Utility trumps business model. If you can't make profit while providing maximum
utility, change your business model before someone else does it for you.
(I.e. don't be like the copy industry.)

Provide a powerful and usable API for extending future's capabilities.
The killer app of a filesystem is making it simpler to write programs that
handle files. The killer apps of a file manager are making it simpler to write
programs where people handle files and making it simpler for people to handle
files (e.g. sort by date, select items from 4 to 28, copy them to another
folder = ls -t | head -n 28 | tail -n 24 | xargs cp -t destdir)

~Where a programmer uses a language, non-programmer uses an application.~

Utility
-------

- Claus and Pjotr have listings of their model train cars on future. Both have
  several copies of some cars and a list of wanted cars. Find possible trades.
  - claus.wanted & pjotr.dupes, pjotr.wanted & claus.dupes

- Paula the photographer wants to find the best photograph from a series
  - first pick the good ones, then do side-by-side comparisons to drop the
    not-best ones, then do side-by-side comparisons between the best to find
    the very best one

- Schedule:
  - move things to the to-read list by clicking the read emblem on them
    - to-read list calculates the total time it takes to read through all and
      shows it to you
    - "read" is a bit of a misnomer, since the to-read list can contain any sort
      of items
    - to-read list can split itself into n-hour chunks to schedule your reading
      across several days
  - when you start reading a document, it is moved to "currently reading"
  - when you finish reading, you tick the "completed" or "skipped" -box to move
    it to one of those sets


Fun
---

- Jaded from the cute fade animations and shaking 24pt font-size login forms of
  Web 2.0, Hezekiel seeks solace from the bosom of future.
  A very feast for the senses! The mix of materials and texture, artful
  design with its detail gradients, animations and fireworks of success renew
  Hezekiel's faith in humanity.

- Beatrice is bored and depressed from the continuous rain.
  The dark grey design doesn't help. Ah, to see the hills of Provence~

- Thomas is testing deleting stuff. The Delete-character with her emergency
  hammer is amusing! Delete more, Thomas, delete more!


Everyday errors
---------------

- Thomas accidentally deleted his collection of kitten pictures and now wants
  it back.


Relaxation
----------

- Beatrice plays Massive Attack and views a slideshow of Provence landscape
  photos while sipping tea.
