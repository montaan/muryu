Current list of buggy things, small-minded usability stuff:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Important:
NOW:
* bug: map title positioning fails if font size differs from hardcoded expectation
* bug: window resize handles don't work, only bottom left works
* doubleclick not obvious
* the sidebars for groups and sets suck
* split session in several parts. In particular:
  - save playlist somewhere else than session
  - save map setup somewhere else than session
  - save notes somewhere else than session
* no "copy url to clipboard" in item context menu

LATER:
* generate item json after edits, store in separate table & memcached for fast access
* search query editor with clickable sort: user: type: etc.
* simulated http workload with a configurable amount of users
  - plus user generator
* player playlist sucks


Somewhat important:
NOW:
* bug: video embed doesn't have correct dimensions
* bug: no feedback on add-to-folder menu
* bug: new folder/group positioning bad
* bug: filenames not visible if top-left tile not visible
* bug: after going to fullscreen mode, map extents not updated
  => stuff disappears before it should
* deleting folders
* deleting groups
* image viewers don't resize
* presentation & slideshow controls too invisible
* sending bug reports
* no "refresh map" in item context menu

LATER:
* messaging between users
* less crappy PDF reader, slideshow is a bit lacking as one
  - make first part of number editable
  - list of page thumbs on side
* uploading n-hundred image zips sucks because
  - no indication of progress
* update view after changes
  - monitor server for last-modified
* itunes-like management view for player
* keep container hierarchy in breadcrumb trail at top
* refuse to zoom into the empty void between the planes of existence
* named arrows to other areas on the map
  - click to go there
* have some circles with arrows emanating from (0,0)?


Not important:
NOW:
* bug: content overflows window borders
* bug: creating new folders in add-to-folder makes the main menu go bye
* player to get artist and title from db
* keep (non-z0) tiles loaded if less than four needed to fill map area
  - i.e. keep toplevel tiles loaded
* slideshow resize is slow. seriously slow.
* can't select text from map

LATER:
* use exiftool instead of exif + exiv2
* image thumbnailing is slow
* ppt thumbnailing is slower
* detect license of uploaded things, use to determine public access
  - if free, allow copy, view, etc, like private
  - otherwise, link to referrer
* show item infos overlay at z9+
* collapse-button for sidebar titles
* sidebar hiding
* create containers from menu
* create searches inside containers
* player playlist context menu for items (nick from ItemArea)
* sha1 challenge-response login for no https
  onsubmit= "this.password_hash.value=hex_sha1(hex_sha1(this.password.value+this.salt.value)+document.cookie.split(/[;=]/)[1]);this.password.value=''"


High priority:
==============

* listing related items for an item
* listing related buyables and auctions for an item
  (amazon, allposters, art.com, ebay)

* have a way to link to a specific item and its browsing context!
  - otherwise no deep in-links => no deep traffic => fail at the interweb!
  - or in-links lacking vital information (comparison: article with
    per-paragraph links, but the paragraph link would show only that paragraph:
    useless) zogen items are less stand-alone than e.g. blog posts, so the
    browsing context is vital.

* support for text-only browsers (and, more importantly, webcrawlers)
  - accessibility for the blind => accessibility for search engine webcrawlers
    => deep in-links => deep traffic => success! (and bigger userbase)
  - more bandwidth-friendly for people from places with bad connectivity
  - the visual version is quite friendly for bad eyesight due to zoomability

* zogen
  * show text items as text
    (get text from tile_info(close zoom) / items(detail floater))


Medium priority (improves use experience / codebase):
=====================================================

* zoom lens and mini map

* IE compatibility
* Safari / Konqueror compatibility
* Opera compatibility

* coloring by source / set / author / poster / other metadata

* list tags
* list items with a given tag

* redirect to wanted page on successful login

* design and implement undo

* server-side-drawn emblems for items
* drawing lines between two items

* rearrange items by dragging
  - use arrangement to infer relatedness, close items are related

* ~~~Ability to do set arithmetic on search queries~~~, dead-simple UI for it
  - intersection, union, complement, substraction
    - A & B, A | B, ~A
    - A - B = (~A & ~B) & (A | B) = ~(A & B) & (A | B)
  - Claus and Pjotr have listings of their model train cars on future. Both have
    several copies of some cars and a list of wanted cars. Find possible trades.
    - claus.wanted & pjotr.dupes, pjotr.wanted & claus.dupes

* Ability to do side-by-side comparisons for items / sets
  - Paula the photographer wants to find the best photograph from a series
    - first pick the good ones, then do side-by-side comparisons to drop the
      not-best ones, then do side-by-side comparisons between the best to find
      the very best one


Low priority (would be nice / possible):
========================================

* special thumbnail handling for multipage docs: big header page with all doc
  pages on the side as tiny, zoom in to read

* ~~~Widgets; have a way to add custom snippets of HTML and JS to the page~~~
  * implemented, but no site-side support
  - examples
    - GMail+GTalk widget for sending links and items to friends
      with a single click, received links in sidebar
    - imageshack widget for uploading an item to imageshack for embedding in a
      forum post
  - outsource services that we don't want to do
  - promote good ones
  - like firefox extensions

* shoutcast stream of owner's music files at the wanted bitrate (high br when
  home at broadband, low br when crappy mobile net. bandwidth implications?)

* drag&drop items on a layout, save layout as web page / pdf == simple dtp

* OpenGL-based client program (cmp. google maps - google earth)
