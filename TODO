* Tests for dbconn #parse_query

* Better thumbnailers for document formats (convert doesn't scale pdfs as 
  vector graphics, so can't get BIG images, probably also missing cropped scale)
  - needed to use tilemap for reading documents (along with a special
    thumbnail handling for multipage docs: big header page with all doc pages on
    on the side as tiny, zoom in to read)

* Move to using the C layouter, rewrite TileDrawer for speed

* Write search query parser (sets:!work sets:todo tags:bank user:carol)
  - half-way there

* Web todo
- write submodes of [users, groups, tags, sets, etc.] -form

- login
  * redirect to wanted page on success

- tags
  * list tags
  * list items with a given tag
- groups
  * view groups you're a member of
  * list users in a given group
- users
  * list users in my groups
  * view user infos
  * view user items, groups, etc.

- upload
  * port semantics from upload.cgi
  * make upload form
  * port future.xpi to use this

- undo
  * design and implement (argh, important feature but a bit painful)

- tile
  * fix threading issues :(
- tile_info
  * fix threading issues :(
  * give different info based on request
    (faster to do indexes-to-items-matching server-side)

- zogen
  * fix threading issues :(
  * use tile_info data to fetch stuff from items
  * use stuff from items to do onhover details and info overlays
  * make tile_info fetches use less requests and queries
  * figure out a way to keep current map coordinates when navigating 
    away from page (in essence making back button work)
    - one way would be suture-style navigation-creates-history-state
      but that spams the history full of crap
  * get nice filenames from tile_info
  * grab sidebar from augen
  * make a complete UI design and implement it utility-first
    - who uses zogen for what
    - what new things can you do with zogen that you couldn't do with existing
      software or would be very inconvenient with existing software
    - floater views (zoomed in map portion, overview map portion)

  * switch to tile-generated-from-item at 256x256 
    (easier to do on server side?)
  * emblems for items
  * drawing lines between two map coordinates (needs universal coord system)

  * nested portal system for doing titled views (instead of drawing on server)
    - subportal engulfs all items inside it, crop to window/container border
      -> zoom changes subportal size
    - subportal info gotten from tileinfo
      - already getting title
    - subportals behave like windows
