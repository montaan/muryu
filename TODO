* Tests for dbconn #parse_query

* Better thumbnailers for document formats (convert doesn't scale pdfs as 
  vector graphics, so can't get BIG images, probably also missing cropped scale)
  - needed to use tilemap for reading documents (along with a special
    thumbnail handling for multipage docs: big header page with all doc pages on
    on the side as tiny, zoom in to read)

* Move to using the C layouter, rewrite TileDrawer for speed

* Write search query parser (sets:!work sets:todo tags:bank user:carol)
  - half-way there

* Web todo
- write submodes of [users, groups, tags, sets, etc.] -form

- login
  * redirect to wanted page on success

- tags
  * list tags
  * list items with a given tag
- groups
  * view groups you're a member of
  * list users in a given group
- users
  * list users in my groups
  * view user infos
  * view user items, groups, etc.

- upload
  * port semantics from upload.cgi

- undo
  * design and implement (argh, important feature but a bit painful)
