* Port tile drawing code from tilegen.rb

* Tests for dbconn #parse_query

* Tests for image cache

* Better thumbnailers for document formats (convert doesn't scale pdfs as 
  vector graphics, so can't get BIG images, probably also missing cropped scale)
  - needed to use tilemap for reading documents (along with a special
    thumbnail handling for multipage docs: big header page with all doc pages on
    on the side as tiny, zoom in to read)
