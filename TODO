High priority (vital for utility / business):
=============================================

* make a complete UI design and implement it utility-first
  - who uses future for what
  - what new things can you do with future that you couldn't do with existing
    software or would be very inconvenient with existing software

* Write search query parser (sets:!work sets:todo tags:bank user:carol)
  - make search query parser actually work

* port future.xpi

* view user items, groups, etc.

* replace crystal icons (globe emblem, mimetypes) with own versions (but in case
  they're free to use, this becomes low priority)

* listing related items for an item
* listing related buyables and auctions for an item
  (amazon, allposters, art.com, ebay)

* have a way to link to a specific item and its browsing context!
  - otherwise no deep in-links => no deep traffic => fail at the interweb!
  - or in-links lacking vital information (comparison: article with
    per-paragraph links, but the paragraph link would show only that paragraph:
    useless) zogen items are less stand-alone than e.g. blog posts, so the
    browsing context is vital.

* support for text-only browsers (and, more importantly, webcrawlers)
  - accessibility for the blind => accessibility for search engine webcrawlers
    => deep in-links => deep traffic => success! (and bigger userbase)
  - more bandwidth-friendly for people from places with bad connectivity
  - the visual version is quite friendly for bad eyesight due to zoomability

* zogen
  * make tile_info fetches use less requests and queries
  * figure out a way to keep current map coordinates when navigating
    away from page (in essence making back button work)
    - one way would be suture-style navigation-creates-history-state
      but that spams the history full of crap
  * show text items as text
    (get text from tile_info(close zoom) / items(detail floater))


Medium priority (improves use experience / codebase):
=====================================================

* port upload semantics from upload.cgi
  - missing compressed and remote compressed

* grab sidebar from augen
* zoom lens and mini map
* nested portal system for doing titled views (instead of drawing on server)
  - subportal engulfs all items inside it, crop to window/container border
  - subportal info gotten from tileinfo
    - already getting title
  - subportals behave like windows

* IE compatibility
* Safari / Konqueror compatibility
* Opera compatibility

* coloring by source / set / author / poster / other metadata

* Tests for dbconn #parse_query

* list tags
* list items with a given tag

* view user infos
* list users in a given group

* redirect to wanted page on successful login

* design and implement undo (argh, important feature but a bit painful)

* server-side-drawn emblems for items
* drawing lines between two items

* rearrange items by dragging
  - use arrangement to infer relatedness, close items are related

* Ability to do set arithmetic on search queries, dead-simple UI for it
  - intersection, union, complement, substraction
    - A & B, A | B, ~A
    - A - B = (~A & ~B) & (A | B) = ~(A & B) & (A | B)
  - Claus and Pjotr have listings of their model train cars on future. Both have
    several copies of some cars and a list of wanted cars. Find possible trades.
    - claus.wanted & pjotr.dupes, pjotr.wanted & claus.dupes

* Ability to do side-by-side comparisons for items / sets
  - Paula the photographer wants to find the best photograph from a series
    - first pick the good ones, then do side-by-side comparisons to drop the
      not-best ones, then do side-by-side comparisons between the best to find
      the very best one


Low priority (would be nice / possible):
========================================

* special thumbnail handling for multipage docs: big header page with all doc
  pages on the side as tiny, zoom in to read

* Widgets; have a way to add custom snippets of HTML and JS to the page
  - examples
    - GMail+GTalk widget for sending links and items to friends
      with a single click, received links in sidebar
    - imageshack widget for uploading an item to imageshack for embedding in a
      forum post
  - outsource services that we don't want to do
  - promote good ones
  - like firefox extensions

* media player for augen sidebar (i.e. musica.js + flash component for playing)

* shoutcast stream of owner's music files at the wanted bitrate (high br when
  home at broadband, low br when crappy mobile net. bandwidth implications?)

* drag&drop items on a layout, save layout as web page / pdf == simple dtp

* OpenGL-based client program (cmp. google maps - google earth)
